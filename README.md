Adopt a Floof is a vanilla JavaScript prototype Pet Adoption App. 

Users can sign up, list a pet for adoption, add pets to their favourites and adopt a pet, making the pet unavailable for adoption to other users.

We encourage responsable pet ownership and remind users that adopting a pet should not actually be this easy.
